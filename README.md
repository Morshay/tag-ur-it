# tag-ur-it

**Deep Learning** project, part of a data science course under Naya College.

*The goal* is to be able to tag anime artwork using [booru-style tags](https://safebooru.donmai.us/tags).  

*The model* is based on [efficient net b4](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946) (V2 wasn't available for me at the time) and is derived from previous work by [RF5](https://github.com/RF5/danbooru-pretrained) and [anthony-dipofi](https://github.com/anthony-dipofi/danbooru-tagger).

*The data* used for training is a small selection (around 1000 images) from the [Great Danbooru Dataset](https://www.gwern.net/Danbooru2021), more specifically - the [safe 512px dataset subset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muoncollider/danbooru2020small).

The entire thing is extremely bare-bones since it's a hand-in project. i do plan on expanding it to include much, much more as i venture forward into the anime-deep-learning space.
